= Kafka Quickstart

== Installing the connector

Download the connector from Confluent hub, then unzip the downloaded folder:
----
unzip juxt-kafka-connect-crux-1.17.1.zip
----

Navigate into the base of the Kafka folder, then run the following commands:

----
cp $CONNECTOR_PATH/lib/*-standalone.jar $KAFKA_HOME/libs
cp $CONNECTOR_PATH/etc/*.properties $KAFKA_HOME/config
----


The connector can be used as either a *source* or a *sink*. In either case, there should be an associated *Crux node* to communicate with.

== Creating the Crux node

To use our connector, you must first have a *Crux node* connected to Kafka. To do this, we start by adding the following dependencies to a project:

[source,clj, subs=attributes+]
----
pro.juxt.crux/crux-core {:mvn/version "{crux_version}"}
pro.juxt.crux/crux-kafka {:mvn/version "{crux_version}"}
pro.juxt.crux/crux-http-server {:mvn/version "{crux_version}"}
pro.juxt.crux/crux-rocksdb {:mvn/version "{crux_version}"}
----

Ensure first that you have a running Kafka broker to connect to. We import the dependencies into a file or REPL, then create our Kafka connected _'node'_ with an associated http server for the connector to communicate with:

[source,clj]
----
(require '[crux.api :as crux]
         '[crux.http-server :as srv])
(import (crux.api ICruxAPI))

(def ^crux.api.ICruxAPI node
  (crux/start-node {:crux.node/topology '[crux.kafka/topology crux.http-server/module]
                    :crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers "localhost:9092"
                    :crux.http-server/port 3000}))
----

== Sink Connector

Run the following command within the base of the Kafka folder, to create a worker which connects to the _'connect-test'_ topic, ready to *send* messages to the _node_. This also makes use of *connect-file-source*, checking for changes in a file called _'test.txt'_:

----
./bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/local-crux-sink.properties config/connect-file-source.properties
----

Run the following within your Kafka directory, to add a line of JSON to _'test.txt'_:

----
echo '{"crux.db/id": "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84", "value": "baz"}' >> test.txt
----

Now, verify that this was transacted within your REPL:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/entity (crux/db node) "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84")
==>
{:crux.db/id #uuid "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c84", :value "baz"}
----

== Source Connector

Run the following command within the base of the Kafka folder, to create a worker connects to the 'connect-test' topic, ready to *receive* messages from the _node_. This also makes use of 'connect-file-sink', outputting transactions to your _node_ within _'test.sink.txt'_:

----
./bin/connect-standalone.sh config/connect-standalone.properties config/local-crux-source.properties config/connect-file-sink.properties
----


Within your REPL, transact an element into Crux:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/submit-tx node [[:crux.tx/put {:crux.db/id #uuid "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c82", :value "baz-source"}]])
----

Check the contents of 'test.sink.txt' using the command below, and you should see that the transactions were outputted to the _'connect-test'_ topic:

----
tail test.sink.txt
==>
[[:crux.tx/put {:crux.db/id #uuid "415c45c9-7cbe-4660-801b-dab9edc60c82", :value "baz-source"} #inst "2019-09-19T12:31:21.342-00:00"]]
