`crux.api` exposes a union of methods from `ICruxAPI` and `ICruxDatasource`,
with few lifecycle members added.

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clojure]
----
(defn start-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependencies on the classpath that the Crux modules may need.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

See https://opencrux.com/reference/configuration.html for details.

Returns a node which implements ICruxAPI and java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.

Throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.

=== new-api-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI.
The remote client requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all calls to `db`.

NOTE: Requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
See https://opencrux.com/reference/http.html for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-ingest-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-ingest-client ^ICruxAsyncIngestAPI [options])
----

Starts an ingest client for transacting into Crux without running a full local node with index.

Accepts a map, or a JSON/EDN file or classpath resource.

For valid options, see https://opencrux.com/reference/configuration.html.

Returns a crux.api.ICruxIngestAPI component that implements java.io.Closeable.
Latter allows the node to be stopped by calling `(.close node)`.
