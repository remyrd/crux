= Developing Crux

The top-level project ties all the other projects together for convenience whilst working within this repo.
All of the below commands should be run in the *root* of the Crux repo.

* To run a Clojure REPL that includes dependencies for all components of Crux, first build the sub-modules using `./lein-sub install`.
* Start a REPL with `lein repl` (with `--headless` if you're just going to connect to it from your editor).
* Once you've connected to the REPL, in the `user` namespace, run:
** `(dev)` to require and go to the `dev` namespace.
** `(go)` to start up the dev node
** `(halt!)` to stop it
** `(reset)` to stop it, reload changed namespaces, and restart it
** `(reset-all)` to stop it, reload all namespaces, and restart it
** if you're using Emacs/CIDER, `cider-ns-refresh` will do all this for you - `C-c M-n M-r`, `, s x` in Spacemacs
** Conjure users can use `ConjureRefresh`, see the https://github.com/Olical/conjure#mappings[docs] for bindings
** see https://github.com/weavejester/integrant-repl[Integrant REPL] for more details.
* You should now have a running Crux node under `(dev/crux-node)` - you can verify this by calling `(crux/status (crux-node))` (in the `dev` namespace).
* Most of the time, you shouldn't need to bounce the REPL, but:
** if you add a module, or change any of the dependencies of any of the modules, that'll require another `./lein-sub install` and a REPL bounce
** if you change any of the Java classes, that'll require a `./lein-sub javac` and a REPL bounce
** otherwise, `(dev/reset)` (or just `(reset)` if you're already in the `dev` ns) should be sufficient.
* You can run module tests from the root of the git repo without a `./lein-sub install`, because of the lein checkouts - all of the tests are in scope here, so things like `lein test :only crux.tx-test` should also work.
* Please don't put any more side-effecting top-level code in dev namespaces - you'll break this reload ability and make me sad.

== Testing

The recommended way of running the full test suite is `./bin/build.sh`.

The test suite relies on the `timeout` command line utility, this comes as a default on Linux but isn't preinstalled on MacOS. You can get it with `brew install coreutils && echo 'alias timeout=gtimeout' >> ~/.bashrc'`

== Releasing

See link:./RELEASING.adoc[RELEASING.adoc]

[NOTE]
====
The GNU version of `sed` is required for some scripts in this project. If developing on Mac (or other BSD variants), install GNU sed.
