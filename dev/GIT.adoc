= Git practices in Crux

A rough guide of how we tend to use Git, in practice.
Obviously use discretion when applying these - they're guidelines, not hard and fast rules.
This is a living document - please feel free to start discussions/raise PRs.

We loosely follow a https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/['git flow'] model.
Differences:

* We develop on the `master` branch, rather than `develop`.
* When we find bugs on a previous release that require patch releases, we create a branch from master named (for example) `1.10.x`.

Other conventions:

* **PRs by default**
+
Simple, uncontroversial changes (typos, say, or other non-code changes) *can* go straight to `master`, within reason, but be aware of the curse of the 'simple change'.
Err on the side of caution if need be.

** PRs (again, within reason) should be atomic - the 'minimum viable merge'.
   If you've got to a point where your change would add value to a Crux user, it can be a PR.
** On the other side, don't include unrelated bugfixes in a larger PR, because we may want to merge those independently of the rest of the PR.
** Where reasonable, try to make the distinction between changes that preserve Crux's behaviour (e.g. refactorings/restructurings) and changes that advance Crux - it's much easier to review a change knowing that it's supposed to behave exactly the same as it did before.

* **Optimise your commits for later reading**
+
Future developers looking back at commits will likely not care about the exact trials and tribulations/learning path you went through to fix a bug/write a feature (though no doubt it felt like an arduous journey at the time).
Consider *why* developers might need to go back and look at commit history and how you'd explain your change to those developers, and organise your commits accordingly - it's probably not "on Tuesday I did this, then on Wednesday I did this"!
Remember, 'future developers' will likely include 'future you' :wink:
+
Commits should be atomic units of change, a transition from a valid state to another valid state - feel free to liberally re-write history on your branch to achieve this.
If a commit doesn't make sense/work independently without another commit, it's probably a single commit.
Likewise, if it's two distinct changes, it's two distinct commits.
+
(FWIW, I tend to make a load of throwaway 'checkpoint' commits - then, when I get to an intermediate working milestone, I'll squash down the checkpoint commits to one atomic commit.
I find this works well, but each to their own.)

* **Prefer a linear history**
+
This is related to the previous point, because it's much easier to reason about/bisect changes if they're linear. It means:

** Prefer rebasing feature branches on `master` to pull in changes from elsewhere over merging `master` into the feature branch.
** When you merge your feature branch back into master, there are a few patterns, depending on the size of the change:
*** Github's 'squash and merge PR' is a reasonable default
*** If it's a single commit, it can go straight onto master (once reviewed)
*** If you want to keep the original commits visible (for git blame purposes, say), `git switch master && git merge --no-ff <branch>` clearly marks out a block of work, preserves your commits, and keeps the history linear.

* **The issue/PR assignee is responsible for progression**
+
There's two parts to this: firstly, if it's you, it's up to you to chase whoever needs chasing, unblock what needs unblocking, replying to whoever needs replying to, figuring out what needs to be done, etc, so that it's complete **end-to-end**.
(This can obviously include delegating out if need be - you don't have to _do_ it all yourself - just make sure you're coordinating it.)
+
With PRs, the assignee is considered to have the 'lock' on the branch.
+
Secondly, though (and probably more commonly) - if it's you and it shouldn't be, or it's not you and it should be, update it (even if that means no assignee) :smile:

* **Use a fork of https://github.com/juxt/crux**
+
This means you're responsible for cleaning up your branches rather than have them cluttering up the main repo and annoying me :wink:
