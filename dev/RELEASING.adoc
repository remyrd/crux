= Releasing Crux

We could automate more of this than we do, but here's a checklist in the meantime.

You can kick off a couple of these in parallel (particularly, `lein build` takes ~10 mins) but note the various 'await' items.

Version number is `Major.Minor.Patch`, e.g. `1.17.1`.
We use https://github.com/ptaoussanis/encore/blob/master/BREAK-VERSIONING.md[BreakVer].

## Git tag:

1. find/replace `<previous-version>` -> `<next-version>`, commit
2. `git tag --annotate --sign <next-version>` (magit `t -a -s t`), add release notes to tag.
3. `git push origin master <next-version>`

## CircleCI
1. Await https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/juxt/crux[CircleCI build]
2. Manually approve hold - this kicks off the Maven deploy, building the API docs, deploying Docker images etc.

## JARs:
1. Head over to https://oss.sonatype.org, 'Log in', 'Staging Repositories'
2. 'Close' the repo (performs validations)
3. 'Release' the repo
4. Check https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/pro/juxt/crux to see when the artifacts have been mirrored across Maven Central.

## Artifacts:

1. Await CircleCI.
2. Await JAR upload (above) - required for Docker images.
3. Retrieve artifacts from build: crux-builder.tar.gz, crux-in-memory.jar

## Docs:
1. Await CircleCI.
2. Create a `docs-v<next-release>` branch
3. Update `docs/reference/antora.yml`:
   * Delete `prerelease: indeed` and `display-version: master` lines
   * Update `version: master` to `version: <next-release>`
4. Commit, push branch to the main JUXT Crux repo
5. Head over to `crux-site`, build and deploy the site
   * Build using `./bin/build-site.sh`
   * Deploy using `./bin/deploy-site.sh`

## Github release:
1. Locate tag on https://github.com/juxt/crux/releases[releases page], click 'Edit tag'
2. Copy release notes into release description
3. Await artifacts, upload artifacts to release
4. Await JARs deploying, and ensure 'docs' section is complete - people get notified at this point.
5. 'Publish release'

## Publicise:

* Zulip
* Clojurians' Slack
* Twitter, if appropriate
